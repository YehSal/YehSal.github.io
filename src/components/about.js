        <p>
          I am a senior at Yale University majoring in computer science. I believe that technology
          is the way of the future and can be utilized in such ways to truly imporve our lives in ways rendered
          unimaginable in the past. I am interested in applying technology to solve complex problems and work on intersting projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a proud self-learner and I am always excited to learn something new be it a new technology or a new recipe,
          especially if its anything related to steak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from my academic interest, I enjoy working out, cooking, and hiking.
